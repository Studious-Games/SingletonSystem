## [1.1.1] - 2022-07-14

Fixed an issue where a singleton was attached to a GameObject, and it would not persist to another scene. This forces the system work like normal, meaning it persists the GameObject it is attached to. If there are other scripts attached to this GameObject, you will need to decide if you need them persisted as well.


## [1.1.0] - 2022-07-14

Fixed an issue with non persistent classes.

Added the ability to use a Locator rather than the static field to retrieve the class instance. In the future it would be good to find a way
to remove the need for using a static instance field to define the Singleton.

Changed the namespace from Studios.Singleton to Studios.SingletonSystem, please be aware that this has changed, and remember to make the necessary changes.

## [1.0.6] - 2022-06-07

Fixed the following:

- Documentation would not display when clicked from with the Package Manager
- Fixed the ability to view the Change Log from with the Package Manager
- Fixed viewing the license from within the Package Manager
- Allowed for the Package to be hidden by default.

## [1.0.5] - 2022-06-05

Added the ability to select what scene a persistent singleton can be unloaded, the caveat to this is that it will destroy all data it contains.

## [1.0.0] - 2022-06-05

This is the initial release of Studious Singleton System,
