# Studious Singleton System
 
 Is a small very simple library, that helps create singletons with ease. From creating persistent Singletons to single usage ones, this library helps make it simple for everyone to get up and running with very little effort.


## Installation

Studious Singleton System is best installed as a package, this can be done in a number of ways, the best is to use git and install via the package manage.

###### **Via Git Hub** 

We highly recommend installing it this way, if you have git installed on your machine, then you can simply go to main page of this repository and select the code button. Then copy the HTTPS URL using the button next to the URL.

You can then open up the Package Manager within the Unity Editor, and select the drop down on the plus icon along the top left of the Package Manager. You can then select add by Git and paste the URL from the GitHub repository here.

###### **Add Package from Disk** 

There are two ways to do this, one would be to unzip the download to an area on your harddrive, and another would be to unzip the download into the actual project in the packages folder.

Both are workable solutions, however we would suggest if you would like to use this for multiple projects, that you install somewhere on your harddrive that you will remember. And then use the Package Manager to add the package from Disk.

Installing or unzipping into the projects package folder, will work out of the box when you open the project up.
